As my first week as a Flatiron student comes to a close, I figure I should reflect on why and how I decided to join the program. The prompt, asking why I want to learn software engineering, feels almost too large to tackle in one post. 

Some of those reasons: I want to be a creator, a role model, a learner, a teacher, a facillitator, an entrepreneur, a maker, a doer.

I could get really cheesy, and go with cliches like: I want to be the captain of my own ship, the director of my own musical, the wind beneath my wings. In short, I want to be one of those people who can *make things happen*.

I've always been interested in tech. I grew up playing video games and I still remember the anticipation I felt listening to AOL establish a connection. I lived in chatrooms and took web development classes in high school almost *15 years ago*, so that feels like a pretty big deal.

Life took me in a different direction, but I find some satisfaction in coming back to coding.

So, what will I make? What will I do? I'm not entirely sure yet, but I can't wait to see what happens!
