I started strong at the beginning of this month: I joined #100DaysofCode, I tweeted my progress, I logged in and coded at least an hour every day.

And thenâ€“well, you know. Life. It's funny how life seems to get in the way sometimes. It starts with one day off, then two... then, all of a sudden, it's been weeks. It feels like that law we learn back in elementary school: an object in motion stays in motion. 

When you stop, you lose momentum. Even worse? Getting back in the swing of things feels really difficult.

Does it matter why we stop? 

I knew my life was going to get a bit crazy with the end of the semester. I am a full-time graduate student and I had an assistantship with our English department. Not only was it finals week, but I would be completing my own projects AND GRADING. 

I graded projects for over 100 students in a short weekend while simultaneously rushing to finish a 10+ page essay on 19th century American literature, a portfolio showcasing my creative writing attempts, and a memo connecting to digital places showcasing the work I put in reading and researching writing studies. 

Did I mention that I also worked in the writing center, I interned with the marketing department, I freelance to make ends meet, and I'm a mom? 

To top it all off, I received a totally unexpected job offer while smack dab in the middle of setting up my own office. 

So, sure, I have plenty of "good" reasons to take a break from coding. 

But you know what? No matter how many "good" reasons I list, I am only justifying to myself. Rather than focusing on all the reasons why coding has been difficult, I want to focus on the reasons I started coding in the first place. I also want to focus on brainstorming ways to fit coding in a messy, busy life.

So, without further ado, here are 7 steps to get started with coding again after a break, however long or well-intentioned that break was:

1.  **Start Slow!** Before your break, you may have been coding at a comfortable clip. When you start again, you should expect to take things slow. You will need to build up momentum again, so plan to start slow. Think about dipping your toes into the pool to test the waters before diving in head first.

2.  **Look Back** When you get derailed, you may "lose your place." Do you remember what skills you were working on? If you have a record, revisit that record. Fortunately, Flatiron students have access to Github; if you have your coding progress saved, take some time to look at what you were working on to jog your memory.

3.  **Make a Plan** Rather than sitting down to "just code," you should spend some time planning. Decide what you will plan to accomplish each day. Start with small, achievable goals to get back on track, and then sit down again to plan your route. 

4.  **Take your Time** Once you have a plan, make sure you account for how long everything will take. Each item you add to your plan will probably take longer than you expect, so leave plenty of buffer time. You might also schedule in additional reading and research time to help you catch back up to where you were. Consider using a method like the Pomodoro method (25 mintues of work, 5 minute break and repeat) to make your goals more approachable.

5.  **Set your Space** Make sure to define where you will work. If you can work from the couch with your laptop in your lap with the TV blaring, you are a stronger person than I am! If you have family or friends that might distract you, especially in a shared space, inform them ahead of time. You can always visit the library, local college, or a coffee shop if you need a different space.

6.  **Minimize Distractions** Distractions happen! If you know what distractons might pop up, you will be better equipped to handle them. Put away your phone and books, shut off the TV, close apps, or disable your notifications so you can concentrate on the task at hand.

7.  **Get started!** Once you have planned your route, prepared your space, and prepped for distractions there's only one step left: just get started!
